# Sample of implementing the AHP matrix in Python



The hierarchical analysis method developed by Thomas Lorie Saaty, in the 70s and 80s, is based on the Newtonian and Cartesian method, as it deals with the complexity of a problem by dividing the problem to be treated into factors down to the lowest level of factor extraction and relatable divisions so that you can later synthesize them. According to Costa (2002) the method is based on 3 analytical steps: I) construction of hierarchies; II) definition of priorities; III) logical consistency.
